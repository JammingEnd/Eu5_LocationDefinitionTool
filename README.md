# EU5 Map Definition Painting tool! 

Over a thousand locations..... heck probably even quintuple that. That is going to be an absolute MEGA task to do manually. luckily i decided to work on a tool that makes this process a lot quicker and easier.

## How to use
Upon starting the app youre prompted with two fields, one for the base game and one for your mod. Use the browse button to open a file explorer and select the root of your project folders.
